MR5 Notes:

Come up with statements to prove in the midterm in class.
Make us take the first steps in class. 

On the number of concepts since the beginning of the semester:
   1. Conditional equivalence <-> Observational equivalence of statments
   2. Conditional equivalence
   3. The effects of refactoring, super refactoring, and tree travelsal with an accumulator.
   
Main statement: Evenness or oddness of fibonacci numbers.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, ...

Theorem: forall 3n-th fib number is even

==========================

If even is even, f(n + 3) is even <-> Exists q s.t m = 3q

If f(n) is odd <-> Exists q s.t m = 3q + 1 \/ 3q + 2


They are living in a logical exclusive OR. Either one is true, but not at the same time.
You need to define a logical exclusive OR.

if (a or b) and (c or d or e) then (a <-> c) <-> (b <-> d or e)

Do induction in one direction and do induction in the other direction.

It is important to notice the pattern of the exclusive disjunction and how it forms a commuting diagram.

==========================

Furthermore, f(0) is even. 

forall (n1 S n1 : fib_numbers):
       ()
       /\
       ()
